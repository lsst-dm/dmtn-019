  To add images, add the image file (png, svg or jpeg preferred) to the
  _static/ directory. The reST syntax for adding the image is

  .. figure:: /_static/filename.ext
     :name: fig-label
     :target: http://target.link/url

In order to test Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) correction algorithms we first need a metric that quantifies the severity of residual dipoles in difference images, in order to evaluate the performance of the correction. 
I used the StarFast simulator (http://dmtn-012.lsst.io, https://github.com/lsst-dm/starfast_simulator) to generate multiple realizations of a small field at u, g, and r bands and across a range of airmasses from 1.0 to 2.0.
I then used ingestSimImages.py and processEimage.py from obs_lsstSim to generate standard calibrated exposures, and ran standard LSST image differencing using imageDifference.py with a calibrated exposure near zenith used as the template (using GetCalexpAsTemplateTask).
