description: 'I use the StarFast simulator to generate many simulated observations of a field at a range of airmasses from 1.0 to 2.0, and at several LSST bands. After differencing each image from the observation in each band closest to zenith, I generate a metric to characterize the number and size of dipoles in the residual.'
